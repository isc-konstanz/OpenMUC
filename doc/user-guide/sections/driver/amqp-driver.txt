=== AMQP

Connects OpenMUC with an AMQP-Broker and writes the records from the queues to channels.
Therefore this driver makes usage of our AMQP-Library, which is described in section <<amqp-lib>>. For configuration
of the AMQP-Connection, the values from the following table have to be set in the channels.xml.

.Configuration Synopsis
[{driver_table_op}, cols="1,4"]
|=========================================================
|ID | amqp
|Device Address | URL of the amqp infrastructure
|Settings | port=<port>;vhost=<vHost>;user=<user>;password=<pw>;framework=<frameworkID>;
parser=<needed <<parser-lib>>>;buffersize=<1-n>;ssl=<true/false>;separator=<e.g. "_">;exchange=<amqp-exchange>
|Channel Address | <name of amqp-queue>
|=========================================================

Parameter description:

* framework and separator: +
To add the information about the source of an amqp queue, the concept of subsection
<<amqp-mapping>> is used. Framework defines the prefix of the amqp queue and seperator the char between
framework and channelID.

* buffersize: +
This parameter makes it possible to optimize the performance at listening and logging huge amounts of records.
The driver waits till it collected the configured number of records, before it returns the whole list to the
data manager. This decreases the number of needed tasks e.g. for writing to a database.

Supported features:

* read channel
* write channel
* listening

Not supported features:

* scan for devices
* scan for all channels
* reading whole devices instead of single channel

After starting this bundle, it connects to the configured amqp host.
The example below is listening for the queue "SmartMeter_power_grid".
