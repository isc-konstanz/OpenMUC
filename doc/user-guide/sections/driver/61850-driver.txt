=== IEC 61850

IEC 61850 is an international communication standard used mostly for
substation automation and controlling distributed energy resources
(DER). The IEC 61850 driver uses the client library from the
OpenIEC61850 project.

*Channel Address*

The channel address should be the IEC 61850 Object Reference and the
Functional Constraint of the Basic Data Attribute that is to be
addressed separated by a colon.  Note that an IEC 61850 timestamp received will be
converted to a LongValue that represents the milliseconds since
1970. Some information is lost during this conversion because the IEC
61850 timestamp is more exact.

*Settings*

The defaults for TSelLocal and TSelRemote are "00" and "01"
respectively. You can also set either TSelector to the empty string
(e.g. "-lt -rt"). This way they will be omitted in the connection
request.
