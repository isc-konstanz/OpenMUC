=== KNX

KNX is a standardised protocol for intelligent buildings. The KNX

supports group read and writes and is also able to listen to the
BUS. The driver uses the calimero library.

The device address consists of the host IP and the IP of the KNX tunnel or router.

*Channel Address*

The channel address consist of the group address you want to monitor and the
corresponding data point ID. A data point consists of a main number and a subtype.
For example a boolean would be represented by the main number 1 and a switch by
the subtype 001, the DPT_ID of a switch is 1.001.
