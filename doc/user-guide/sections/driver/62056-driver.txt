|=========================================================

*Device Address*

<serial_port> - The serial port should be given that connects to the M-Bus converter.
(e.g. /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux).

*Settings*

_Baud rate change delay_ _-d_ sets the waiting time in milliseconds between a
baud rate change default is 0. +
_Timeout_ _-t_ sets the response timeout in milliseconds, default is 2000. +
_Number of read retries_ _-r_  defines the maximum of read retries, default is 0. +
_Baud rate_ _-bd_ sets a initial baud rate e.g. for devices with modem configuration,
default is 300. +
_Device address_ _-a_ is mostly needed for devices with RS485, default is no device address. +
_Fixed baud rate_ _-fbd_ activates fixed baud rate, default is deactivated. +
_Request message start character_ _-rsc_ is used for manufacture specific request
messages. With this option you can change the default start character. +
_Read standard_ _-rs_ reads the standard message and the manufacture specific message.
This options has only an affect if the _Request message start character_ is changed.

*Channel Address*

<data_set_id> - Id of the data set. It is usually an OBIS code of the format
A-B:C.D.E*F or on older EDIS code of the format C.D.E.that specifies exactly what
the value of this data set represents.
