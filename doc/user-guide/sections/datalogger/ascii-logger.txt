=== ASCII Logger

==== General Information

The log files adhere to the following naming scheme: YYYYMMDD_loggingInterval.dat
If you have channels with different logging intervals or change a channels logging interval a new file is created
for that logging interval. If OpenMUC is stopped and restarted on the same day or there are problems like a power
outage that create holes in the data, new files will be created for this date while the old ones will be renamed
.old or .old2 .old3 etc. in case it happens multiple times on one day.

==== Configuration

For the ASCII Logger there are two options you can change.

You can choose whether you want enable file filling mode instead of renaming asciidata files to *.old after a
OpenMUC restart. This will fill the time frame without data with data points that show err32 for every channels
value. You do this by adding the following line:

[source]
----
org.openmuc.framework.datalogger.ascii.fillUpFiles = true
----

The other option concerns the file path of the logger. By default it is set to <openmuc_folder>/data/ascii or
you can change it through adding this line:

[source]
----
org.openmuc.framework.datalogger.ascii.directory = <path>
----

==== Structure 

The log files' header shows you the following information:

* ies format version
* file name
* file info
* timezone relative to gmt (i.e. +1)
* timestep_sec (time between entries in seconds)

It also shows information about the columns, the first three columns show the time while the others are the logged channels.

* col_no
* col_name
* confidential
* measured
* unit
* category (data type and length)
* comment
