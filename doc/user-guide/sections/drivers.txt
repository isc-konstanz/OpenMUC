== Drivers

=== Install a Driver

For installing a new driver you have two possible ways.

==== Copy driver
Copy the corresponding driver jar file from the folder "build/libs-all/" to the
"bundle" folder of the framework. Many drivers are "fat jars" which include their
dependencies. An exception is the RXTX library which cannot be packed
with the jars.

==== Editing bundles configuration
In /openmuc/framework/conf/bundles.conf.gradle you can find the list of all used
bundles e.g.:

----
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-driver-csv", version: openmucVersion

osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-webui-spi",  version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-webui-base", version: openmucVersion
----

If you want to add a new driver to the list, e.g. M-Bus, you can do this:

----
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-driver-csv",  version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-driver-mbus", version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc",           name: "jrxtx",               version: "1.0.1"

osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-webui-spi",   version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-webui-base",  version: openmucVersion
----

Afterwards you have to execute in /openmuc/framework/bin/
----
./openmuc update-bundles
----
If this is the first time using ./openmuc update-bundles you have to add the parameter -i
----
./openmuc update-bundles -i
----

==== Use a Driver with Serial Communication

When you need to use a driver that uses serial communication you have
to copy the RXTX bundle to the frameworks "bundle" folder.

----
cp ../dependencies/rxtx/jrxtx-1.0.1.jar ./bundle/
----

Additionally you need to install librxtx-java:

----
sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
----

The serial ports /dev/tty* are only accessible to members belonging to
the group dialout. We therefore have to add our user to that
group. E.g. using:

----
sudo adduser <yourUserName> dialout
----
