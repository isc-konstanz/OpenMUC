This document describes the first steps with emonmuc (**E**nergy **mon**itoring **M**ulty **U**tility **C**ommunication controller), an open-source protocoll driver project to enable the communication with a variety of metering or other devices, developed based on the [OpenMUC](https://www.openmuc.org/) project.

---------------

# 1 Setup

With both components installed and running, the OpenMUC framework needs to be registered to the emoncms user. This can be done in the Controllers page, accessible at **Setup->Device Connections** from the menu.

Click **Controllers->New controller** and confirm the default settings, if the framework is running on the same machine.  
Energy meters and other utility devices connected to the platform can now be configured in the **Device Connections** site.


# 2 Coming soon

*This section is a placeholder and will be filled with guides and tutorials on how to use this framework in the near future.*
