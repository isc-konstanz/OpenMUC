=== M-Bus (wired)

M-Bus is communication protocol to read out meters.

.Configuration Synopsis

|=========================================================
|ID | mbus
|Device Address |   <serial_port>:<mbus_address> or
tcp:<host_address>:<port>
|Settings |   [<baudrate>][:timeout][:lr][:ar][:d<delay>]
[:tc<tcp_connection_timeout>]
|Channel Address |   [X]<dib>:<vib>
|=========================================================

*Device Address*

<serial_port> - The serial port should be given that connects to the M-Bus converter.
(e.g. /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux).

<mbus_address> - The mbus adress can either be the the primary address or secondary
address of the meter. The primary address is specified as integer
(e.g. 1 for primary address 1) whereas the secondary address consits of 8 bytes
that should be specified in hexadecimal form. (e.g. e30456a6b72e3e4e)

tcp - with this option M-Bus over TCP is used.

<host_address> - The host address for M-Bus over TCP e.g. 192.168.8.89.

<port> - The TCP port for M-Bus over TCP e.g. 5369

*Settings*

<baudrate> - If left empty the default is used: "2400"

<timeout> - Defines the read timeout in ms. Default is 2500 ms. Example: t5000
for timeout of 5 seconds

<lr> - Link reset before readout.

<ar> - Application reset before readout.

d<delay> - Inserts a delay between every message, including link reset and application
reset. Delay in ms.
A delay with 100 ms and activated link reset and application reset results in a total
delay of 300 ms.

tc<tcp_connection_timeout> - The TCP connection timeout is need for a defined timeout
when no TCP connection could established.

*Channel Address*

Shall be of the format <dib>:<vib> in a hexadecimal string format (e.g. 04:03 or 02:fd48)
The X option is used for selecting a specific data record.

=== M-Bus (wireless)

Wireless M-Bus is communication protocol to read out meters and sensors.

|ID | wmbus
|Device Address |   <serial_port>:<secondary_address>
|Settings |  <transceiver> <mode> [<key>]
|Channel Address |   <dib>:<vib>
|=========================================================

*Device Address*

<serial_port> - The serial port used for communication. Examples are /dev/ttyS0
(Linux) or COM1 (Windows)

<secondary_address> - The secondary address consists of 8 bytes that should be
specified in hexadecimal form. (e.g. e30456a6b72e3e4e)

*Settings*

<transceiver> - The transceiver being used. It can be 'amber' or 'rc' for modules
from RadioCrafts.

<mode> - The wM-Bus mode can be S or T.

<key> - The key in hexadecimal form.

*Channel Address*

Shall be of the format <dib>:<vib> in a hexadecimal string format (e.g. 04:03 or 02:fd48)
